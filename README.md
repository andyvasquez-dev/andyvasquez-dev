I was taught that nothing is given and everything is earned. In middle school, I had the opportunity to join the Sumo Bots club where I got to code and build sumo bots from scratch to fight other robots, a 12-year-old’s dream. Our perseverance and collaboration led my team and me to win a tournament. It was a testament that hard work and cooperation pays off. Today as a software engineer, I build digital services for businesses in my community who lack an online presence & technical expertise. I’m looking to join your software engineering team, continue to grow, and hopefully one day I can empower other 12-year-olds in my community to pursue a STEM career.
